# ðŸŽ© Fogg
Fogg is a component library that stems from the need to quickly spin up new mapping applications with search capabilities. While the library contains generic components needed within a typical map-based dashboard, the Lens component is what serves as the flagship component to wrap a map.

This library is packaged as a Gatsby theme that  can be easily imported to a project.

## What's inside?
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for templating and static site generation
- Gatsby relies on [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the UI framework
- [Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-11-11-introducing-gatsby-themes/) are utilized to provide a reusable starting point for mapping UIs
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is used as the presentational UI and documentation
